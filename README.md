# Conference Talk Proposals
This is a place for me to keep track of talk proposals I have submitted to various conferences.

The goal is to encourage transparency about what a talk proposal looks like and to encourage others to submit talks. Writing your first talk proposal can be daunting! Having examples helps.

The outcome will be updated for all proposals. Any feedback received, links to videos, notes on other places a talk has been submitted, etc. will all be added.
